# FIBox Vulnerable Lab
## This Project is not Complete
FIBox is vulnerable web application only for File Inclusion Attack.

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a type of vulnerability in web applications that allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the server. The vulnerability arises when an application uses user-supplied input as part of a file path without proper validation or sanitization, making it possible for an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files, sensitive data, and potentially even the source code of the application itself.

A Local File Inclusion Vulnerable Lab is a simulated environment for security researchers and students to practice identifying and exploiting LFI vulnerabilities. It typically consists of a web application that has been intentionally designed to contain LFI vulnerabilities and other security flaws, allowing users to test their knowledge and skills in a controlled and safe setting.

These labs provide a hands-on approach to learning about security and can be a valuable resource for improving one's understanding of LFI vulnerabilities, as well as other types of web application security issues. They can also be useful for preparing for certification exams or demonstrating one's proficiency to potential employers.

However, it's important to note that exploiting LFI vulnerabilities on a live system is illegal and unethical. Hence, it is recommended to only practice on labs specifically set up for educational and research purposes, and not on any live or production systems.
